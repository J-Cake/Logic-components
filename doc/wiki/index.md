# LogicX Wiki

Welcome to the LogicX Wiki. Here you can find most of what you will be looking for relating to the technical aspects of the application, Interface, Usage, or other related info.

## FAQ

### What actually is LogicX?
LogicX is a platform that allows you to play and experiment with the rules and behaviours of logical components, giving you an applied opportunity to explore and learn how computers do the incredible work they do. You don't need knowledge on electrical components at all to use LogicX, just bring yourself and dive in.

### Is LogicX free?
Yes, absolutely. LogicX is completely free and Open-Source with no ads, ever. You can check out the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/J-Cake/Logic), or just use the prebuilt application [here](https://logic.jschneiderprojects.com.au)

### I don't know the first thing about computers, where do I start?
LogicX is highly documented with in-depth tutorials and examples for you to try out. Check it out in the [Wiki section](/wiki/usage%2FGetting%20Started.md)

### I've found a bug
LogicX is still only in development, that doesn't surprise me ðŸ™„. Feel free to report it on [GitHub](htt[s://github.com/J-Cake/Logic/issues/new])

### LogicX is draining my battery and overheating my computer
As mentioned, LogicX is still young and this is to be expected, but I'm constantly making improvements to it to try to alleviate this. If you have any suggestions to how this can be improved, please start a thread on the [GitHub Discussion Board](https://github.com/J-Cake/Logic/discussions).

At the moment, the way LogicX is rendering the components is quite wasteful on both memory and CPU, and reducing it is a top priority, however, until the development reaches a Beta stage, this is a secondary priority. If you're interested in development progress, take a peek at the [GitHub Projects page](https://github.com/J-Cake/Logic/projects/1)

### Do you send me ads or newsletters?
As mentioned before, LogicX is free and Open-Source with no ads. In my mind, newsletters are advertisement, and they get annoying, thus LogicX will not send you any emails unless it's absolutely necessary.

### LogicX is awesome! How do I support it?
A great way to support LogicX is through feedback and feature requests via GitHub, but if you're looking into supporting the development process, I will have to politely decline.
LogicX is my year 12 HSC Major project, and it **must** be my own work for it to qualify, thus, until the HSC, I can't take any code contributions, even if I'd love to.

## About
LogicX is a project for the HSC exam. A requirement is a portfolio. If you're interested in the project portfolio, it's actually available on this website. [Check it out here](/res/folio.html)
