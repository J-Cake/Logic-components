# Getting to know the Interface

> For an introduction to what LogicX is, [see the about page](/wiki/%2FLogicX%2Fabout.md)

When you first visit LogicX, you'll be greeted with a simple landing page. You'll find a list of buttons up top to
explore different areas of the website. If you haven't already, create an account to get started making and designing
circuits. After you sign up (or log in, if you've already done this), you should be greeted with your dashboard.

From here, managing documents is a breeze. With a very ominous-looking <icon></icon> button, you can create a document.
Once you enter the name of your document you will be taken to the *editor* where you believe it or don't, *edit* the
document. As you'd expect from applications focused around designing, the toolbar provides many easily accessible tools
and features needed for the basic editing process, with more sophisticated and less-used tools in the tool
drawer (`ctrl+shift+p`). All buttons have corresponding key combinations for convenience. A full table of shortcuts can
be viewed [here.](/wiki/%2F%2FLogicX%2Fusage%2FInterface.md)

The most useful tools are placed in the middle of the top toolbar for convenience. These are explained in the table
below

| Tool       | Icon            | Shortcut                   | Description                                                             |
| ---------- | --------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pointer    | <icon></icon> | `1`, `p`                   | Interacts with components by triggering updates.                        |
| Select     | <icon></icon> | `2`, `b`                   | Selects components and wire nodes.                                      |
| Move       | <icon></icon> | `3`, `g`                   | Allows wire nodes and components to be moved around.                    |
| Wire       | <icon></icon> | `4`, `w`                   | Connects and links components.                                          |
| Debug      | <icon></icon> | `5`, `d`                   | Mark components to halt on when they receive certain update conditions. |
| Label      | <icon></icon> | `6`, `l`                   | Change component identifiers for use in simulation.                    |
| Delete     | <icon></icon> | `delete`, `backspace`, `7` | Disconnects components and removes them from the document              |
| Components | <icon></icon> | `F9`, `8`                  | Add components to the document                                         |
| Import     | <icon></icon> | `F10`, `9`                 | Convert documents into components, for use in the document.            |

The first thing you will need is the component menu, as this is how you will add all components to your document. Open
the menu with `8`, and move the window to a convenient location. ![Component Menu](/res/Component-Menu.png)

Clicking on any of the components listed in the menu will cause the app to switch back to the viewport, where moving the
mouse across the screen will allow you to position the component. Once you are satisfied with the position,
left-clicking will drop the component in-place. Do this for all components you need in the document. There is no limit
to the number of components you can have, or what type, as long as it appears in this menu, they can be used in the
document.

Once you are satisfied with your components, or at any point in between, you may connect the components together. First,
select the *Wire* tool with `w` or `4`. Follow the [wiring guide](/wiki/%2F%2FLogicX%2Fusage%2FWiring%20in%20LogicX.md)
for an in-depth tutorial on wiring.
