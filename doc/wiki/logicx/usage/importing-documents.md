# Importing Documents

Importing documents allows documents to be used inside other documents. It involves a process by which documents you
create are converted into components you can use in other documents. There are two ways to embed documents in other
documents. These are by converting them into Stateless or Stateful
components. [See the difference here](/wiki/%2FLogicX%2Fstatefull-vs-stateless.md).

When you import a document, you will see a list of your documents that you can select to
import. ![Import Documents](/res/importer.png)
Please note that when you do this, any changes you make to the original document will **not** be synchronised. There is
currently no way to resynchronise them, however if you feel this is necessary, please upvote this
on [Github](https://github.com/J-Cake/Logic/discussions/categories/ideas)

> Note, for slower connections, this may take several seconds to compete.

After the conversion is complete, you will be taken back to the finder screen, where your new component will be listed.
From here you can use the component like you would otherwise.
