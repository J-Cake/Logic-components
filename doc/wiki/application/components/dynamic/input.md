## Synopsis:

*Input*s allow the user and other components to interact. They act as bridges between components and users.

## Activate

There is an internal state, indicating whether an active or inactive signal should be broadcast. Activating the
component toggles this.

## Notes

*Input*s are used throughout LogicX to find and inform from the terminals of documents and components. They serve a
special purpose within many core LogicX functions as these provide the basis of cross-component interaction.
